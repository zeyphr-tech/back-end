Zeyphr is a decentralized Web3 marketplace and crypto-native payment platform built using the IOTA EVM. It enables users and businesses to transact seamlessly, both online and offline, with familiar Web2-like user experiences—email logins, one-tap payments, QR scan, and more—while abstracting away the blockchain complexities underneath.

## 📣 A Kind Note for Judges

After our May 4th submission, the [IOTA EVM Faucet](https://github.com/iotaledger/evm-toolkit) we used was deprecated. Since our “Bank Deposit” feature wasn’t ready before the deadline, we relied on the faucet to fund wallets.

To ensure a smooth demo, we allocated 4500 IOTA to a central wallet. New users now receive 100 IOTA on signup to try key features like scan & pay, transfers, and purchases.

You can watch our [demo video](https://youtu.be/2_dmkKHpmGk?si=LUITiZmzf1zUCH3Y) and compare it with the current app — you won’t notice any critical new features.

If you have any questions, please feel free to email us at [2020ad0149@svce.ac.in](mailto:2020ad0149@svce.ac.in). We’re happy to help and usually respond within 14 hours.
